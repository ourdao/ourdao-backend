// Direct coverage for src/db/migrate.ts (issue #162). Before this file,
// migrate() — called on every real boot by both src/index.ts and
// src/worker.ts — was only ever exercised indirectly via test/setup.ts's
// one-time bootstrap call, and every other test file built its database
// from schema.sql alone (test/db.ts). That gap is why the duplicate-0014
// defect (issue #161) reached main undetected: three files claiming version
// 14 are invisible to a suite that never loads migrate.ts's loader.
//
// test/setup.ts already calls the real migrate() once, globally, before any
// test file runs, so by the time this file's tests execute, schema_migrations
// already holds every real migration in migrations/. That's used here rather
// than fought: these tests exercise migrate() being called again against
// that already-migrated database (the same thing that happens on every real
// process restart), rather than tearing down and rebuilding the shared test
// database that every other test file also depends on.
