/**
 * Apply the schema.

 * schema.sql is the bootstrap baseline: idempotent CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS
 * statements describing the *current* desired shape, safe to run on every
 * boot. It's sufficient for a brand-new database, but IF NOT EXISTS cannot
 * express changing something that already exists — an added column, a
 * widened type. Those live as numbered files in migrations/ and are applied
 * here, in order, exactly once per database, tracked in schema_migrations.
 *
 * A database that's freshly bootstrapped from schema.sql already has every
 * migration's end state (schema.sql always reflects HEAD), so pending
 * migrations are recorded as applied without re-running their SQL. A
 * database that predates a migration gets that migration's SQL executed for
 * real. Serialized across the API/worker with a Postgres advisory lock.
